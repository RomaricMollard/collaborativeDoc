# CollaborativeDoc
A simple php/angular application using togetherJS to make a live and collaborative documentation in many styles (markdown, html, REST API, text)
I made this program to improve my developpers productivity while we worked on an other project. I didn't found anything like that, so it can be usefull for someone else !

This is a simple and absolutly not secured software running on php and html/js. It use TogetherJS (but can work without TogetherJS), angular and Ace.js.
You can create files and links them like a simple html website, some module are added to convert your input from markdown or an API language I created.

CollaborativeDoc has also a basic backup system.

## Dependances
You need a php webserver, no SQL needed.

## Installation
Just download this folder, run a php server and go to index.html in a browser.

## Use
Files are saved automaticly, you can choose editing pane, mixed pane or view pane.
To create a new file, just create a link in your start page and go on it (see the demo).
